2. It will come with npm version 8.3.1 or greater.
3. Run npm install command from the project folder where package.json is located.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, to run the application, you can use:

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `npm run build`

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
